that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit together
at the table of brotherhood i have a dream that one day even the state of MIssissippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering
with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. i have a dream.
