hi guys. I'm kamal and I love automation. 

Have you ever thought of making your own animation show? well, I did.

but I don't know the first thing about animation.

So I start to learn how to draw and learn about animation. It was hard at first, but I got the hang of it after a while, but it took a lot of time. creating one minute of mouth movement takes me around one hour work. it was fun at the beginning but I got bored doing it. Because it was a repeating process and I hate repeating processes. so I started looking for a way to automate the process. 

so I start watching other not-so-cool animation videos on a different channel.  I realize some of the processes are repeating. for example mouth movement, eyes, and emotion. I thought I can automate this process. with the help of carykh ideas and its channel. the dream become reality. 


I made this software. in it you don't have to worry about any animation drawing, all you have to do is provide the information in a CSV file and the software will do its magic. the video you are watching right now is made by my software.


the best part about this software it is by changing one to two  in the CSV file I can switch between different characters. like this. like this this. huh. cool right? you can use your custom character too.  which I will explain in a different video AND the working of this software.

if you like the idea. I can make this software publicly available for you guys through a website. 

. please do share your thoughts and subscribe to my channel ok

I WILL SEE YOU IN THE NEXT VIDEO. TAKE CARE bye
